					High Performance Messaging System  (fjavier.porras@gmail.com) 
================================================================================================

Hi. This a TCP/IP SERVER messaging system that scales horizontally (at least that was the idea)

It has been written JAVA, although a part is written in OpenCobol/C++.

Please find instructions in ./_doc directory 

	Hope you find it, useful. Comments and any new idea to improve it, will be welcomed.

 
		Best Regards. Javier
